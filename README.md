# Expression Replacer

## Small proof-of-concept expression replacer written in C#.

This expression replacer assumes that no side-effects are possible, meaning we can replace any expression with their value.

## Running
### On Linux:
- You need the ```dotnet-sdk``` to be able to run C# code.
- To run the code, simply run the following command in your shell while being in the project directory
```
dotnet run
```

### On Windows
- Using Visual Studio, open ```ExprReplacer.csproj``` and run the program inside the IDE.
